## 📦 Reusable Sidebar Component

We use a modular JavaScript sidebar, auto-injected into all pages:

```js
import { initSidebar } from './sidebar.js'
initSidebar()
```

Each page must have:
```html
<div class="dashboard">
  <!-- Sidebar injected here -->
  <div class="main-content">...</div>
</div>
```
